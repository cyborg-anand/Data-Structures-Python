## üïπÔ∏è Introduction to Big-O Notation

Big-O notation describes the time complexity of algorithms as the input size grows. Understanding Big-O is essential for writing efficient code.

### O(1) - Constant Time (Constant)
An operation that takes the same amount of time regardless of input size.
- **Example**: Accessing an element by index in an array.
- [View Code Example]()

### O(n) - Linear Time (Proportional)
An operation where time grows linearly with input size.
- **Example**: Looping through an array.
- [View Code Example]()

### O(n¬≤) - Quadratic Time (Loop within a Loop)
An operation where time grows quadratically with input size.
- **Example**: Nested loops (e.g., bubble sort).
- [View Code Example]()

### O(log n) - Logarithmic Time (Divide & Conquer)
An operation that reduces the input size by half each step, such as binary search.
- [View Code Example]()
